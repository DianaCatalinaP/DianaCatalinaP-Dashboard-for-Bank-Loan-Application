*Bank Loan Applications Tracking Dashboard*

In this project, I built a Bank Loan Applications Tracking Dashboard to analyze and visualize key loan metrics such as application trends, approval rates, and interest rate performance. This dashboard provides actionable insights to help monitor loan processing and identify important patterns.

What I did
Collected and prepared loan application data for analysis.

Designed interactive visualizations to track trends over time.

Created charts to display approval rates, interest rates, and other relevant metrics.

Implemented filtering options to explore the data by different dimensions.

Developed the dashboard layout for easy navigation and clear presentation.

This repository showcases my process and the final product â€” a comprehensive tool for loan application tracking and analysis.
